## Setup

### Install the package
The environment that we use is given in `environment.yml`. You can consider to use exactly the same environment by running the following command.
```
Conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Please navigate to the root of this repository, and run the following command to install the package e2efold.
```
source activate rna_ss # activate the enviornment
pip install -e .
```

### Data

Please download the RNA secondary structure [data](https://gocuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/yuli_cuhk_edu_hk/EsmL09vDN3RDucN4I3JyOdEBpD4M4ToqShvYu57-1nOFoA?e=236Pix) and put all the `.tgz` files in the `/data` folder. Then run:
```
tar -xzf rnastralign_all.tgz
tar -xzf rnastralign_all_600.tgz
tar -xzf archiveII_all.tgz
```
These files contain the processed data. As a reference, the codes for preprocessing the data are also given in this `/data` folder.

### Folder structure

Finally the project should have the following folder structure:

```
e2efold
|___e2efold  # source code
|___e2efold_productive  # productive code for handling new sequences
|___data  # data
    |___archiveII_all
    |___rnastralign_all_600
    |___rnastralign_all
    |___preprocess_archiveii.py  # just as a reference. no need to run.
    |......
|___models_ckpt  # trained models
|___results
|___experiment_archiveii
|___experiment_rnastralign
|___slides_and_articles    # slides and articles related to the project 
...
```

## Prediction for user's input sequence

To directly use our trained model to make prediction for any RNA sequence, please refer to the information in `/e2efold_productive` folder.

## Reproduce experimental results in the paper

To reproduce the experiments in our paper, please refer to the following steps:

## Test with trained model
You can download the [pretrained models](https://gocuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/yuli_cuhk_edu_hk/Ekuec1yiSc9Jp7leSEYtsvABJyhIVXAblV0wb-8PrTezMg?e=eqXvzd) and put the `.pt` files in the folder `/models_ckpt`.

### RNAStralign
You can navigate to the `/experiment_ranstralign` folder and run the following command to test the model on RNAStralign test dataset:
```
python e2e_learning_stage3.py -c config.json --test True
python e2e_learning_stage3_rnastralign_all_long.py -c config_long.json --test True
```

### ArchiveII
You can navigate to the `/experiment_archiveii` folder and run the following command to test the model on ArchiveII data. Note that the saved model is trained on the RNAStralign database.
```
# For sequences shorter than 600
python e2e_learning_stage3.py -c config.json

# For sequences from 600 to 1800, not performing well on long sequence in archiveii
python e2e_learning_stage3_rnastralign_all_long.py -c config_long.json
```

## Reproduce the training process or re-train the model on a new dataset

The model is trained on the RNAstralign training set. To reproduce the training process, you can navigate to the folder
`e2efold_rnastralign` and run:
```
# For sequences shorter than 600
python e2e_learning_stage1.py -c config.json  # pre-train the score network
python e2e_learning_stage3.py -c config.json  # end-to-end training

# For sequences from 600 to 1800 
python e2e_learning_stage1_rnastralign_all_long.py -c config_long.json 
python e2e_learning_stage3_rnastralign_all_long.py -c config_long.json 
```

Given the training logic implemented in the above python files, you can modify the data generator to re-train the model on other datasets. Our data generator in defined in `e2efold/data_generator.py`. You could probably choose to define a Sub Class based on the Class `RNASSDataGenerator`.
